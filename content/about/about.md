Drabick Services is your go-to handyman company for any job you want done right - the first time. I offer fair pricing and bring a wide range of skills to any project, large or small. Based in Dormont, I do work throughout the South Hills, but am willing to travel further for some projects. In addition to typical handyman projects, I run a lawn care service in the summer and snow removal in the winter. In my spare time, I produce bespoke furniture, using unique reclaimed wood and custom metal-working. I try to respond to requests as quickly as my schedule allows, typically in one to three business days. If you have a job, please reach out!
